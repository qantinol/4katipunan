            The creator changes the URL and server every 3 days.Plus, as you may
            know since ur in this forum already, he/she puts the website access
            on newspapers that NOBODY reads ever since journalism basically became
            st*te-controlled. <b> - Anonymous 1918</b>

        <article>God, I remember the days when the murders were vile and vulgar to us.
            Now, it's literally routine. Eat, work, watch someone get shot
            because he disagreed with the boss, get home, sleep. Im completely desensitized now.
            How did we get here?

            You have nothing to fear. this website moves, remember? it can NEVER

        <article>I hate to say it, but I was one of those who stood by.
            I was hesitant to join this group, because I feared for my life.
            But I just watched the police brutally kill my last relative, because
            she uttered the SMALLEST defiance to her parking ticket. This is not

            Pretty much 4 years now. This community started off super secretive
            but slowly increased in members as the g*v**nment started taking
            extreme measures. Nobody knows who the creator is, just that he/she
            ghostwrites for multiple journalist companies to secretly get close
            enough to access the editor's file of the newspaper. That's where 
            he/she changes the barcode.<b> - Anonymous 33423</b>
